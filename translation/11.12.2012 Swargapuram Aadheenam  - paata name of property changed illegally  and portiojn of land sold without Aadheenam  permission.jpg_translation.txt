Subject: Request for inspection based on the petition to retrieve the properties owned by Sorkkapur Adheenam.
The authorities conducted an inspection on the properties owned by Sorkkapur Adheenam. They found that proper administration was not carried out, and all properties were not managed properly. Some properties were alienated without proper authorization. Additionally, Partition No. 148 has been subdivided and sold to many individuals. Some properties were alienated without proper authorization. In this area, a residential building has been sold as a commercial property without proper approval. I request an immediate investigation and retrieval of the property, along with the cancellation of unauthorized alienations. Furthermore, a commission should be appointed to oversee and take necessary actions. I request immediate action with a detailed report. I have attached a list with the petition number, partition number, and property details for your reference. When contacting the Inaiyar Office in Chennai regarding this matter, they have been instructed to continue communication with their office. I urge them to expedite the process and provide a prompt response.
