Precedent
In the case of Raj v. Swamy (1964) 4556 Mad., after the demise of the appellant, Valli, who had inherited the estate from her mother in 1964, the respondents claimed the property based on an alleged will executed by Valli in 1967. They joined the legal heirs in possession and filed a suit for partition in 1995. The trial court dismissed the suit, and the High Court affirmed the decision. The appellants, being dissatisfied with the judgment of the High Court, filed an appeal before the Supreme Court, which is pending.

- The appellants' mother executed a settlement deed in favor of her daughters, one of which was the subject of the dispute. The appellants, as legal heirs, claimed that they had a right to the said property. However, the lower court dismissed their claim, and the matter is now pending before the Supreme Court for adjudication.
