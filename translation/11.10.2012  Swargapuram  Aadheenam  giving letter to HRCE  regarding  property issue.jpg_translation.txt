Subject: Request for investigation into the properties owned by Sorakkapur Adheenam
and the submission of a petition in this regard.
They have misappropriated the properties belonging to Sorakkapur Adheenam.
Without proper administration, they have mismanaged all the properties
and have transferred some properties to themselves. Some properties have been transferred
without proper authorization. Additionally, in Pul No. 148, there are
subdivided portions sold to several individuals. The properties have been transferred. In this
residential area, properties have been sold as residential plots and
are being sold with immediate effect. They are requested to return the properties and
further investigate the properties that belong to the Math. Additionally, a commission has been appointed
to take action and submit a report. I request your prompt action on this matter. Along with this, I have attached a list
of receipts, pul numbers, and property details. I have attached a detailed list for your reference. When it comes to the matter, when the
Commissioner's Office in Chennai is contacted, they have sent a letter
asking to continue the communication with their office. I urge for swift action
in the coming days after they have seen this letter.
