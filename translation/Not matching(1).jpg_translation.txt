Pursuant to the administration of the temple, lands, and properties of the Kilaimadu, the beautiful temple town of Thiruchitrambalam, is dedicated to the deity Maruthavana, also known as Nanjai, Punjai lands are provided as endowments. The assets of the Kilaimadu, worth billions, are enjoyed by the residents who have encroached upon and are experiencing them.

In earlier times, those who were trustees of the temple sold the assets, performed misdeeds, and mismanaged the administration, causing the temple's idols and 63 Nayanmars, as well as other temples, to be neglected. This matter has not been addressed by any action to date.

Currently, the temple of Sri Maruthavana Swami Lingam, 1 Ambal idols, 2 Nandis, 1 Balipeetam, 1 Chandikeswarar idol, along with the idols, trees, and structures, including the mandapams, are currently being safeguarded and maintained, and an airplane is also stationed there at all times.

I, the undersigned, Sivapiragash Desikar Pandaraskanadhi, the third son of the late Shanmugavadivel, started residing in this temple from the day I remembered my lineage, and I have been residing in this property, located at Plot No. 144, 3 acres, 15 cents, in Sent Punnai.

I, along with my grandfather Shanmugavadivel, my grandmother Saroja, my wife Rajeswari, and my son Gangatharan, have established a shop in this village, from which I derive income to conduct the annual Gurupoojas and regular pujas at this temple. I have not borrowed or purchased anything from anyone. No action has been taken by any district officials, Hindu Religious Department, or individuals regarding this matter. I request the community to guide me in conducting the temple and its worship in a proper manner.

Your truthful,
