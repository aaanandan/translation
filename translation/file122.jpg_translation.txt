Regarding everyone,
In the past several years, despite efforts, warnings, and direct supervisory instructions, these thieves have continued to engage in wrongful acts and killings ranging from lower to higher levels. Action must be taken through legal proceedings, investigations, law enforcement officers, administrative authorities, and the judiciary, as well as through the electronic surveillance of the relevant authorities.
2) These officers must pay close attention and vigilance to prevent these killings and thefts from recurring. They must not allow opportunities for these crimes to happen again.
3) It is necessary to inform the most revered and primary deities in temples about the occurrence of thefts at least to a minimal extent, and during times when there are no festivals, to avoid disturbing the deities. The respected Pattasharyaar committed a crime and misdeed at the Arulmigu Raghsobalaswamy Temple, and subsequently, continued to engage in thefts and killings, claiming to be following the temple's customs, and committed inappropriate acts at the Arulmigu Porajaswamy Temple in Sanchipuram, including disturbing the sanctity of the goddess shrine with inappropriate actions.
4) These thefts and crimes recur repeatedly due to various reasons, and it is imperative to understand that the negligence and inaction of law enforcement officers and security personnel contribute to the recurrence of these crimes and thefts.
5) In order to prevent and stop such killings and thefts, it is necessary to provide detailed reports on suspicious activities and incidents to your superiors, authorities, and informants promptly, in accordance with the legal procedures, to ensure immediate action and to be informed and confirmed by the authorities.
6) It is essential to inform the deities and primary deities to the highest extent. During times when there are no festivals, the deities must be protected from disturbances. Without proper security, the deities should not be disturbed.
It is essential to inform the deities of any disturbances that occur at night during the festival, and if it is not possible to prevent disturbances, the temple sanctuaries must be cleaned. Daily reports must be submitted to ensure the safety of all deities in the security box.
In the security post:
2) Night security guards should be of sound age. They must be well trained and vigilant to protect and guard against threats. They should be provided with necessary equipment and tools to carry out their duties effectively. If there are individuals with special abilities who can contribute to the security measures, they can be employed as night security guards.
In protecting the deities, rules must be followed. Individuals with criminal backgrounds should not be appointed as security guards. They should not be allowed to enter or touch the sacred places. During daytime, when the security guards are on duty, they should ensure that all visitors comply with the security regulations. When the night security shift changes, they must hand over the responsibility to the next shift with proper documentation.
