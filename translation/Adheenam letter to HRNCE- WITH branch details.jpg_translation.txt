Ayya,
For the Sarkkapur Adhinam, the lands belonging to the Adhinam including fields and garden areas are under the personal possession of individuals. These individuals, as with their personal properties, are selling and exchanging lands. During the time of land transactions, the District Collector, through direct registration and by imposing restrictions through the registration department, has not caused any harm. They are selling as their personal properties, and are also imposing restrictions. To prevent this, I request to conduct a survey and document the properties to reach an agreement with Sarkkapur Adhinam through a petition. Additionally, I request the Hindu Religious Endowments Department officials to conduct rituals and annual ceremonies at Sarkkapur Adhinam's properties. Furthermore, I wish to collaborate with the officials of the Hindu Religious Endowments Department to conduct group ceremonies at Sarkkapur Adhinam and to submit details of the properties of the personal lands to the officials for a few days and request them to hand over to their office.
